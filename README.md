## At a very high level, here are the questions and the findings of said questions: 
Does CO2 emissions correlate with increased energy production?
 - Not explicitly
Does increased energy output overall correlate with higher average temperatures?
 - There is a correlation
Is the climate reported by news proportionally to the emissions of C02?
 - Not proportional to CO2

An outline and working collaborative document showing vetting of potential data sources, formulation of central ideas, and several data sources that would be potentially interesting to explore in parallel with the data already outlined in this presentation:

## Data cleanup and investigation
The "Data Input and Cleanup.ipynb" notebook contains code to pull in, clean, and export several data sets from Kaggle and the NYT. The resultant CSVs were passed into the corresponding question notebooks, designated with "Question_#" in the notbook names.
